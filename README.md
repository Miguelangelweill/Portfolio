# homework2
* This homework is about creating a page about our selves by linking multiple html's and having one master css for all three of those html pages.
* I personally would have liked to make one fluid html page that I can just scroll down on all the information and have the option to directly go to it by linking it to my navigational system. But sense the homework said make three differemt html and my professor will not be the one grading it I just followed the Instrucions
